      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        <i>AfroNex Energy</i> was founded with a simple but powerfull belief:
        <br />access to electricity should not be a privilege, but a right.
        Across Africa, <br />millions live without power supply, which limits
        education, healthcare, <br />and economic opportunities. We exist to
        bridge this gap, by harnessimg clean, <br />renewable technologies.
        <i>AfroNex Energy</i> tackles the urgent challenges <br />of energy
        access, affordability and sustainability.
