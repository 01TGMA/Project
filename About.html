      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To deliver sustainable, affordable, and reliable clean energy solutions
        <br />that empower African communities, drive economic growth, <br />and
        protect the environment.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Vission</h2>
      <p>
        A future where every African home, business, and community thrives with
        <br />access to renewable energy, fostering innovation, opportunity, and
        <br />a greener planet for generations to come.

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        <i>AfroNex Energy</i> was founded with a simple but powerfull belief:
        <br />access to electricity should not be a privilege, but a right.
        Across Africa, <br />millions live without power supply, which limits
        education, healthcare, <br />and economic opportunities. We exist to
        bridge this gap, by harnessimg clean, <br />renewable technologies.
        <i>AfroNex Energy</i> tackles the urgent challenges <br />of energy
        access, affordability and sustainability.

        <h3>Generation</h3>
        <p>
          Africa's economy continues to grow so does access to sustainable and
          affordable <br />sources of energy to meet rising demand for power.
          Also as Africa's economy continues to grow at a remarkable pace,
          <br />
          driven by innovation, entrepreneurship, and a rising middle class. As
          industries expand and urban centers flourish, the demand for reliable
          electricity <br />
          surges across the continent. In response, access to sustainable and
          affordable energy sources is steadily improving empowering
          communities, <br />fueling progress, and laying the foundation for a
          more inclusive and resilient future.

        <h3>Transmission</h3>
        <p>
          Transmission of electricity is a critical, often overlooked aspect of
          the <br />African energy sector that requires improvement. While
          significant strides have been made in <br />power generation,
          especially through renewable sources—the ability to deliver that
          energy efficiently across <br />
          vast and diverse regions remains a major challenge. In many cases,
          electricity is produced <br />but cannot reach the communities that
          need it most due to outdated, fragmented, <br />or insufficient
          transmission networks.

        <h3>Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          This focuses more on the utility performance and the Last mile
          connection where <br />the consumers are connected to. In Africa, this
          stage focuses heavily on utility performance and the last-mile
          connection, <br />which refers to the infrastructure and systems that
          physically connect homes, businesses, <br />and public facilities to
          the grid.The last-mile connection is often the most complex and costly
          part of electrification. <br />It involves navigating difficult
          terrain, low population density, and limited financial returns. Yet,
          it's also the most transformative,<br />
          bringing light to schools, powering clinics, enabling small
          businesses, and improving quality of life.

        <h3>Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency</h3>
        <p>
          Mini-Grids powered by renewable energy sources are becoming the
          preferred means of<br />
          providing electricity access to remote areas. These decentralized
          systems bypass the limitations <br />of traditional grid extension,
          offering a cost-effective, scalable, and environmentally sustainable
          alternative. As hardware<br />
          costs for solar panels, batteries, and smart meters continue to fall,
          and digital innovations like mobile money and remote monitoring become
          <br />mainstream, mini-grids are transforming the energy landscape.
          They provide reliable electricity for households, schools,
          <br />health clinics, and small businesses—unlocking economic
          opportunities and improving quality of life.
