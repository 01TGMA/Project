      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        AfroNex Energy was founded with a simple but powerfull belief: access to
        electricity should not be a privilege, but a right. Across Africa,
        millions live without power supply, which limits education, healtcare,
        and economic opportunities. We exist to bridge this gap. By harnessimg
        clean, renewable technologies, AfroNex Energy tackles the urgent
        challenges of energy access, affordability and sustainability
